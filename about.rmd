## About Me


I am currently working as an environmental researcher in the Klamath Basin and completed an MS in Systems Ecology in spring 2021.


I grew up near Mt. St. Helens in SW Washington. I completed my BS at Washington State University Vancouver (WSUV) in 2017. During my BS, I was privileged to conduct research abroad on a tall ship with Sea Education Association (SEA) and at WSUV with Drs. Gretchen Rollwagen-Bollens and Steve Bollens. 


My work is fueled by my passion for clean water and community engagement in water quality. 


I love keeping chickens, growing my own food, and other home projects, trail running, and painting.
