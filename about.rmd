title: "About Me"
---

I am a graduate researcher at the University of Montana. I will complete my MS in Systems Ecology in November 2020.

I grew up near Mt. St. Helens in SW Washington. My background is in aquatic and marine ecology and chemistry. See the Research tab for more details about my skills and experience.

I am seeking to apply my skills to a position in water resources science or research and development.
