## Welcome!

I often go by Kate. I made this website to connect about aquatic science, natural resource management, and community engagement. Look for information about me and the work I've done on other tabs and check out updates below.

## Updates

**November 2021**

I wrapped up my MS in spring 2021 (publication in progress) and started a position as an environmental researcher and data scientist in the Klamath Basin at the start of 2021. I work with Tribal agencies and scientists in the Upper Klamath Lake and Klamath River to wrangle and analyze data for water quality projects. Additionally, I have been conducting fieldwork on the Klamath River in support of projects investigating aquatic algae and macrophytes, including toxic algae surveys. 

I am currently working on a contract basis and seeking additional roles in teaching, data visualization, and environmental research and fieldwork. 


**July 2020** 

I have been earning an MS at the University of Montana as I study metal contaminants in the Clark Fork River. **Now, I am looking for a job!** I am seeking a position in the sciences to contribute to projects in water quality, resource management, and data science.
