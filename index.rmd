## Welcome

I am a consulting scientist providing reliable services in data collection and analytics, as well as both computer and field-based environmental research. I specialize in water sciences, including skills and experience in water quality, hydrology, and aquatic ecology.

My experience is varied and includes:

- water quality and environmental pollutants 

- lentic and lotic ecology, including trophic dynamics and invasive species

- data management, including data extraction, big data, and organization

- hydrologic connectivity and sediment loading from roads and trails

- NEPA compliance, including environmental assessments and scientific reporting

- data analytics and reporting for a varied audience, including managers, members of the public, lawmakers, and peer-reviewed publication

- data collection and field-based research in tough environments

## Updates

**January 2024**

Over the past few years I have been expanding my client base and the types of projects I am able to take on thanks to the support of several collaborators and contractors in the Pacific Northwest. I have continued to survey algae and macrophytes annually on the Klamath River, as well as leading fieldwork efforts on road sediment surveys in California. 

**November 2021**

I wrapped up my MS in spring 2021 (publication in progress) and started accepting contracts as an environmental researcher and data scientist in the Klamath Basin at the start of 2021. I work with Tribal agencies and scientists in the Upper Klamath Lake and Klamath River to wrangle and analyze data for water quality projects. Additionally, I have been conducting fieldwork on the Klamath River in support of projects investigating aquatic algae and macrophytes, including toxic algae surveys. 

I am currently working on a contract basis and seeking additional roles in teaching, data visualization, and environmental research and fieldwork. 


**July 2020** 

I have been earning an MS at the University of Montana as I study metal contaminants in the Clark Fork River. **Now, I am looking for a job!** I am seeking a position in the sciences to contribute to projects in water quality, resource management, and data science.
