## Civic Engagement


I am deeply passionate about clean water issues and the relationship between humans and aquatic ecosystems. There are many excellent causes to support, and sometimes it feels overwhelming to understand where to focus my time and energy. Currently, I am a Clean Water Commissioner with Clark County Public Works. I spent my time in Montana facilitating community dialogue around the competing water uses in Montana. I have also gotten involved in organizing panel discussions featuring women in science roles. Prior to moving to Montana, I worked with middle school-aged girls at a water quality camp, helped to organize campus lectures about carbon tax legislation in Washington, spoke with middle school aged kids about pathways in science, and many more directions.


If you have a project involving environmental quality that could use support, data analysis, ideas, or a listening ear, please send me an email!
